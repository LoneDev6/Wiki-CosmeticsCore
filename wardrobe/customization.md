## Locations

You have to set the world and its coordinates, you can also set the yaw and pitch rotations.\
To get these values just use `/coords` command of **Essentials** or use `F3`.

### Camera location

Command: `/cosmeticsconfig config set camera-location`

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png>)

### Mannequin location

Command: `/cosmeticsconfig config set mannequin-location`

Location of the player to preview the cosmetics in the wardrobe.

### Teleport area

This is a bit different, you have to set two points which represent the area in which the player can enter to open the wardrobe.

Command: `/cosmeticsconfig config set door-area-locations`

<div align="center">

<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt="">

</div>

### Exit location

Command: `/cosmeticsconfig config set exit-location`

Location where the player will be teleported back when they leave the wardrobe.

      enabled: true
      min: 2

## Graphics customization

```yaml
    slots:
      colors:
        not_owned: 195,147,57
        owned: 56,67,100
        wearing: 57,70,195
        wearing_preview: 195,120,57
        max_amount_reached: 111,111,111
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
### Warning

Colors must be int RGB colors separated with a comma, you can get them from any color picker.\
HEX and integer colors are not supported for now.
{% endhint %}

To generate these colors you can use any website which offers an **RGB color picker**.\
For example [this one](https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB\_Color.html).

These properties are used to set colors of the slots in the wardrobe GUI.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (18) (1).png>)

* **Not owned**: color of the cosmetics not owned (no permission)
* **Owned**: color of the cosmetics owned (with permission)
* **Wearing**: color of the cosmetics currently equipped
* **Wearing** preview: color of the cosmetics currently equipped but not owned (no permission), equipped only as preview&#x20;
* **Max amount reached**: color of all the other cosmetics which cannot be equipped because the player is already wearing the max amount for that category&#x20;
